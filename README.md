#Getting and clearing data - course project

##Files

* run_analysis.R - script to generate tidy data. Requires zip data file to be in the same dir.
* UCI HAR Dataset.zip - zip file that contains raw data
* CodeBook.txt - code book that explains the columns in the tidy data set produced by the script.
* tidyData.txt - tidy data set generated by the script


##Steps to generate tidy data

####1. Unzip data file

####2. Create train set

Read the following files as tables: 
* subject_train.txt
* X_train.txt
* y_train.txt

Concantenate them in one data set

####3. Create test set by repeating the same steps as for train set

####4. Append both data sets to create one data sets with all subject samples (like union in sql)

####5. Drop columns  that are not mean or std

Read features.txt file to obtain column names. Obtain index for column names that contains mean() or std(). Use that index to filter the data set columns.

####6. Name activities in the data set

Read activity_labels.txt to obtain activity ids and names relations. Perform a merge between activity labels table and data set table by activity id. Then change the column order to put activity_id column in last position.

####7 - Create tidy data set

Calculate mean of all measure columns by subjectId and activity in a new data set. Write new data set to tidyData.txt
